## NodeJS Reverse proxy

A way to get websites showing up through proxy on a single domain.

Installation:

```bash
npm install
```

And you'll be done!

Once started, go to the URL where it is running, and visit `/proxy/<domain>`, where domain is the place / website 
you wanna go to, and then you'll find it running there, boom!
